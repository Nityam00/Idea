# Idea
Based on health
I am Nityam Agarwal from ISE department of R.V. College of Engineering
My idea is to help ambulances reach their destination on time.. This can be achieved by several sensor signals linked to the device.. Like Ultrasonic sensors connected to Arduino and then as soon as a wave propagation is felt by the signal the signal changes its Colour and then safely allows the ambulance to pass by
